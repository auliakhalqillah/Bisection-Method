# Bisection-Method
Bisection method is one of bracketing methods for finding root of the function. This program has been implemented in Fortran 95 program and make sure you have the Fortran 95 compiler in your computer.
# The Package
In this package have two files:
1. Bisection.f95
2. bisectionPlot.m (Matlab)
# How to use?
I use function of f(x) = x^2+2x+1 to find root using bisection method. As we know, these funtion has root of -1 (solving by factorization in mathematically). 

There are three parameters input have to set:
 - Initial Boundary = -3
 - Final Boundary = 3
 - Data Length = 100

The program has been written for detecting the root of the function automatically. So, you can input whatever the boundary values are. Remember, Initial Boundary always more less than Final Boundary.

To plot the result, you can use bisectionPlot.m file (Matlab). Finally, you can find the result in figure bisection.png
